Architecture Overview
This architecture combines application deployment, database setup, and scalable infrastructure in AWS using Terraform to manage and automate provisioning.

Components
1. Application Layer
Employee Dashboard UI:
A web application developed using Java and packaged into a .war file.
The .war file is deployed on an Apache Tomcat server running on an EC2 instance.
2. Database Layer
Amazon RDS (MySQL):
Hosts the application's backend database.
Provides a managed MySQL database service with features like automated backups, replication, and scaling.
Allows secure communication with the application layer via private subnets and security groups.
3. Infrastructure Layer
Amazon EC2:

Hosts the Tomcat application server.
Provisioned with the required software using Terraform and user-data scripts.
Security group allows inbound traffic for SSH, HTTP (8080), and communication with the database.
Amazon S3 (Optional):

Stores assets like images, configuration files, or backups.
Amazon VPC:

Isolates the application's infrastructure with subnets:
Public Subnet: For the application server.
Private Subnet: For the database.
Elastic Load Balancer (Optional):

Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for scalability and high availability.
Flow
User Interaction:

Users interact with the Employee Dashboard UI hosted on the Tomcat server through their browsers.
Application Server:

EC2 instance runs Apache Tomcat, serving the .war file application.
Java application communicates with the RDS database for CRUD operations.
Database:

Amazon RDS (MySQL) stores all application data, such as employee details.
Networking:

Security groups ensure secure communication:
Database only accepts requests from the EC2 instance's security group.
EC2 accepts traffic from specific ports (e.g., 8080 for HTTP).
Deployment Workflow
Development Phase:

Package the Java application into a .war file using Maven.
Store the .war file in a source repository (e.g., GitHub).
Provisioning with Terraform:

Use Terraform to:
Set up VPC, subnets, and security groups.
Launch an EC2 instance for the Tomcat server.
Set up an RDS MySQL instance.
Configure the EC2 instance using user-data scripts to:
Install Java, Maven, MySQL client, and Tomcat.
Deploy the .war file.
Database Initialization:

Use Terraform provisioners to connect to the RDS instance and initialize the database schema and seed data.
Testing:

Verify application deployment and database connectivity.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Use AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
Scale the architecture as needed (e.g., Auto Scaling for EC2, read replicas for RDS).
Key AWS Services
Service	Purpose
Amazon EC2	Hosts the Tomcat application server.
Amazon RDS	Provides a managed MySQL database.
Amazon S3	Stores static assets or configuration files.
Amazon VPC	Ensures network isolation and security.
AWS IAM	Manages access controls.
AWS CloudWatch	Monitors logs and performance metrics.
Optional Enhancements
Load Balancing:

Use an Elastic Load Balancer to manage traffic for high availability.
Auto Scaling:

Configure Auto Scaling groups for the EC2 instances to handle variable traffic.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Automate the deployment process using AWS CodePipeline or Jenkins.
Secret Management:

Store sensitive data like database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.
